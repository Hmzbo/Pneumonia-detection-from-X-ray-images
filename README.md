# Pneumonia detection from X-ray images

In this project, three CNN architectures are used and compared in the pneumonia detection task.

 - VGG
 - Inception
 - ResNet

The used data is available on Kaggle (link in the jupyter notebook).

The trained models are also available in case you need to use them or to reproduce the results.

The models are trained locally on an Nvidia GTX 1050ti GPU, the training duration and more details are available in the notebook.
